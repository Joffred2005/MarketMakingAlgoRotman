This Algorithm was made as a market making algorithm on a VERY-UNFRIENDLY market simulation.

Trend trading beat this algorithm 9/10 times, however the algorithm proved to be quite consistent as provided in the PDFs.

The profit margins are adjustable (I have them quite low to remain competitive).

The code is quite messy as it was coded under a lot of pressure and with not a lot of time.

The algorithm is run with an API key to connect to the trading software, I have left it blank.
